## 3. Economic Rationale  
Trump cites three core objectives:  
1. **Trade Deficit Mitigation**: Countering "large and persistent" deficits by forcing reciprocity under the **Golden Rule** ("treat us like we treat them")[1][5].  
2. **Supply Chain Security**: Addressing dependency on foreign adversaries for critical goods (e.g., defense-industrial base)[1].  
3. **Domestic Manufacturing Revival**: Incentivizing U.S. reshoring through tariffs and deregulation[1][5].  

The White House claims these policies mirror past successes, such as:  
- **First-term tariffs**: Led to $15.7B in steel investments and 3,200+ jobs[5].  
- **IEEPA Authority**: Used to counter harmful practices like currency manipulation and exorbitant VATs[1][3].

## 4. Potential Economic Impacts  
### **Supporting Arguments**  
- **Job Creation**: A 2024 study estimates a 10% global tariff could add **2.8M jobs** and grow GDP by $728B[5].  
- **Price Stability**: The Economic Policy Institute found minimal inflationary effects from Trump’s first-term tariffs[5].  
- **Sectoral Growth**: Steel/aluminum tariffs spurred $10B+ in U.S. investments and reduced imports by ~33%[5].  

### **Criticisms**  
- **Higher Consumer Costs**: Tax Foundation warns of price increases for cars, auto parts, and other imports[2].  
- **Global Recession Risks**: Media outlets like *The New Yorker* and *Politico* warned of retaliatory tariffs and economic slumps during past trade wars[5].  
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: EU officials highlight risks to interconnected industries, particularly in automotive manufacturing[2].

## 5. International Reactions  
### **Retaliatory Measures**  
- **Canada**: Imposed 25% tariffs on $30B of U.S. goods (e.g., peanut butter, motorcycles) and threatens to expand to $155B[2].  
- **EU**: Preparing countermeasures while signaling openness to negotiations[2][4].  
- **China**: Criticized the tariffs and hinted at retaliatory actions, though specifics remain unclear[2].  

### **Diplomatic Tensions**  
- **USMCA Partners**: Exemptions for Canada/Mexico aim to preserve North American supply chains, but non-compliant goods face 25% tariffs[1][3].  
- **EU and Allies**: Express concerns over escalating trade wars, particularly impacting automotive and agricultural sectors[2][4].

> 
> Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants the latest tariffs proposed or imposed by Trump as of April 5, 2025, and they want it organized into specific sections. First, I need to parse through the search results provided.
> 
> Looking at the search results, there's a lot here. The first result from the White House fact sheet mentions a 10% global tariff effective April 5, and higher tariffs on countries with large trade deficits starting April 9. That's a key point. The second source, Kiplinger, adds more details about the 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts effective April 3 and May 3. The third link from HK Law confirms the 10% global tariff and notes exemptions for USMCA-compliant goods from Canada and Mexico. The fourth source has a detailed list of countries and their reciprocal tariffs, which is helpful for section two. The fifth link from the White House talks about the rationale, citing past successes and studies.

> Now, organizing this into the user's requested sections:
> 
> 
> 1. **Recent Tariff Proposals/Implementations**: The 10% global tariff starting April 5 and the higher reciprocal tariffs on April 9. Also, the 25% on cars and auto parts from Kiplinger.
> 
> 
> 2. **Countries and Products Targeted**: Need to list countries. The fact sheet mentions 57 countries for reciprocal tariffs, and the fourth source lists countries with specific percentages. Products: almost all imports except steel, aluminum, autos, pharma, etc. Also, Canada and Mexico have existing USMCA exemptions.
> 
> 
> 3. **Economic Rationale**: The White House fact sheet and the fifth source both mention rebuilding the economy, protecting sovereignty, addressing trade deficits, and using the Golden Rule. Past studies cited showing job creation and investment.
> 
> 4. **Economic Impacts**: The fifth source has conflicting views; studies from 2024 and USITC suggest positive effects, but The New Yorker and Politico mention risks of slumps or global economic fallout. Also, Tax Foundation notes higher consumer prices.
> 
> 
> 5. **International Reactions**: Canada and Mexico retaliated with tariffs, EU preparing countermeasures, China hinted at retaliation. Need to check which sources mention these—Kiplinger and the fourth link talk about Canada's response and EU's stance.
> 
> Wait, the user is asking for the latest as of April 5, 2025. The 10% global tariff is effective that day, so that's current. The higher tariffs on April 9 are upcoming. The auto tariffs started April 3, which is recent. So all these are relevant.

> 
> Need to make sure each citation is correctly linked. For example, the 10% and 50% reciprocal tariffs are from [1][3], Canada and Mexico exemptions from [1][3], auto tariffs from [2], countries list from [4], rationale from [1][5], economic impacts from [2][5], and international reactions from [2][4].
> 
> 
> Also, check for overlaps and combine information where necessary. For example, the auto tariffs are mentioned in both [1] and [2], but [2] gives more details on dates. Exemptions are covered in [1][3].
> 
> Make sure each section addresses the user's points. The rationale should include the IEEPA use, addressing trade deficits, reciprocity, and past successes. Economic impacts need to balance the positive studies and the potential negative effects cited in the news.
> 
> 
> International reactions: Canada and Mexico retaliated, EU preparing measures, China's response, etc. Need to attribute each to the correct sources.

> Avoid using markdown in the thinking, but the final answer should use headers, bullet points, and citations properly.
