# DevinWritingNotes

This repository serves as my GitHub Pages root for personal notes, research, and other writing tasks. The content is organized by task, with each task having its own dedicated folder to maintain a clean structure.

## Repository Structure

- **Index Page**: The main [index.html](https://hollistercole.github.io/DevinWritingNotes/) serves as the gateway to all content, organized by task category.
- **Task Folders**: Each writing task has its own folder (e.g., `/zurich-restaurants`, `/zermatt-attractions`) to keep the organization clean.
- **File Formats**: Content is available in both HTML and Markdown formats, depending on the specific needs of each task.
- **Images**: All images are stored locally in an `images` folder within each task folder to ensure reliability and avoid external linking issues.
- **Lessons Learned**: A [LessonsLearned.md](https://github.com/hollistercole/DevinWritingNotes/blob/gh-pages/LessonsLearned.md) file contains best practices, tips, and solutions to common issues encountered during content creation and publishing. **Refer to this document when stuck on a task.**

## Content Guidelines

### Organization
- Create a new folder for each distinct writing task
- Name folders descriptively using kebab-case (e.g., `city-guide`, `research-notes`)
- Include an index.html file in each folder for easy navigation

### Images
- Store all images in an `images` directory within the task folder
- Download and save images locally rather than embedding from external sites
- Use relative paths to reference images (e.g., `./images/photo.jpg`)
- Optimize images for web before adding them to the repository

### File Naming
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `zurich-restaurants.html`, `research-summary.md`)
- Include the year in filenames for content that may be updated annually
