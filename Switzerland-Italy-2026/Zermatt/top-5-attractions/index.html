            <h2>1. Visit the Matterhorn</h2>
            <img src="./images/matterhorn.jpg" alt="The iconic Matterhorn mountain peak" class="attraction-image">
            <p>The Matterhorn is one of the most recognizable mountains in the world with its nearly symmetrical pyramidal peak. Standing at 4,478 meters (14,692 feet), this iconic mountain is the symbol of Switzerland and the centerpiece of your Zermatt experience.</p>
            <p>While climbing the Matterhorn is for experienced mountaineers only, there are plenty of viewing opportunities for everyone. The mountain's distinctive peak is visible from many locations in Zermatt, but the most spectacular views come from dedicated viewpoints accessible by cable cars and mountain railways.</p>
            <p>What makes it special: The Matterhorn is not just a mountain—it's a Swiss national symbol. Its perfect pyramid shape and the way it stands alone make it uniquely photogenic. The mountain changes appearance throughout the day as light shifts across its faces, offering different perspectives from sunrise to sunset.</p>
            
            <div class="info">
                <p><strong>Best Viewpoints:</strong> Gornergrat, Rothorn, or Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</p>

                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> <span class="highlight">The north face of the Matterhorn is best photographed from Zermatt village, while the east and south faces are viewed from Gornergrat or the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise.</span></p>

            <p>The Gornergrat Railway is Europe's highest open-air railway, offering a breathtaking journey from Zermatt to the 3,089-meter (10,135 feet) summit of Gornergrat. This cog railway has been operating since 1898 and provides some of the most spectacular mountain views in Switzerland.</p>
            <p>The 33-minute ride takes you through forests, alpine meadows, and rocky landscapes, crossing bridges and tunnels along the way. At the top, you'll find an observation platform with panoramic views of 29 peaks over 4,000 meters, including the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa, and the Gorner Glacier—the second-largest glacier in the Alps.</p>
            <p>What makes it special: Beyond the incredible views, the Gornergrat Railway is an engineering marvel that has been running for over 120 years. The combination of historic railway technology with unparalleled alpine scenery makes this journey unforgettable.</p>

            <h2>5. Take the 5 Lakes Walk (5-Seenweg)</h2>

            <p>The 5 Lakes Walk (5-Seenweg) is one of Zermatt's most popular hiking trails, taking you past five beautiful alpine lakes—Stellisee, Grindjisee, Grünsee, Moosjisee, and Leisee. Each lake offers a different perspective of the Matterhorn, with some providing perfect reflections of the mountain on calm days.</p>
            <p>The trail covers about 9.8 kilometers (6.1 miles) with moderate difficulty and takes approximately 2.5-3 hours to complete. The path winds through varied terrain, including alpine meadows filled with wildflowers in summer, pine forests, and rocky landscapes, offering constantly changing scenery.</p>
            <p>What makes it special: Each lake has its own unique character and setting. Stellisee is famous for its mirror-like reflection of the Matterhorn, while Grünsee (Green Lake) is surrounded by pine trees, Grindjisee features marshy shores, Moosjisee has a striking blue color from glacier runoff, and Leisee offers a swimming opportunity in summer with a dedicated recreation area.</p>
