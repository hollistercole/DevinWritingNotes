## Season-Specific Considerations

Our trip is planned for June 2026, which is early summer in Switzerland and Italy. This timing offers several advantages:

- **Switzerland:** Most hiking trails will be open, cable cars and mountain railways operating on summer schedules, and alpine flowers in bloom. Weather should be pleasant with temperatures around 15-25째C (59-77째F).

- **Italy:** Early summer in Milan and Venice means warm weather (20-30째C/68-86째F) but before the intense heat and largest tourist crowds of July/August.

All recommendations in this guide are verified to be available during our June travel dates.
